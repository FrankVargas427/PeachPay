PeachPay is a savings account for everyday crypto. By simply staking your crypto and maintaining it in our system, we will execute automatic investments to increase your crypto.

## How to run

This project utilizes a virtual machine with the framework of Laravel in it, so to run this you will need to use Vagrant to run the machine in the Homestead folder. For more information and more detailed steps on how to initialize and configure the Homestead virtual machine, please consult this link. https://laravel.com/docs/4.2/homestead#installation-and-setup

Once initialized, the virtual machine should boot up with an accesible link for peachfarm.test.
