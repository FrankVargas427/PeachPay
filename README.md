PeachPay is a savings account for everyday crypto, a web or mobile loan app and passive income generator. By simply staking your crypto and maintaining it in our system, we will execute automatic investments to increase your crypto.

## How to run

This project utilizes a virtual machine with the framework of Laravel in it, so to run this you will need to use Vagrant to run the machine in the Homestead folder. For more information and more detailed steps on how to initialize and configure the Homestead virtual machine, please consult this link. https://laravel.com/docs/4.2/homestead#installation-and-setup

Added to this project is a .yaml with some configurations needed for the VM to function.

Once initialized, the virtual machine should boot up with an accesible link for peachfarm.test.

## Description

With their phone number, the user will be able to send and receive payments from anywhere in the world and use PeachPay as savings to generate passive income.

## Updates:

- Updated only to a saving mode
- The integration of RIF is used to be able to authenticate the user and they are thinking of doing the interaction by voice and with a password, which will be much simpler.
- The future of the application is to be able to integrate RNS with the wallet, facilitating the user in backcground mode and also linking it to their voice.


## Our Thoughts
We think that RIF is an amazing technology and we are going to continue with the project or some variant.
